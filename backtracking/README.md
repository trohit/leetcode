| backtracking type  | Time complexity | Comment         | Eg.             |
| -------------------| --------------- |-----------------|-----------------| 
| Subsets            | O(2^n)          | to choose or !  | [], [1]         |
| Combinations       | n!/(n-k)! * n!  | no dups  nCk    | [1,2]           | 
| Permutations       | n!              | order matters   | [1,2],[2,1]     |
