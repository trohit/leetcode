# Backtracking

| backtracking type  | Time complexity | Mnemonic            | Eg.             |
| -------------------| --------------- |--------------------|-----------------| 
| Subsets            | O(2^n)          | to choose or !     | [], [1]         |
| Combinations       | n!/(n-k)! * n!  | n elms,k slots nCk | [1,2]           | 
| Permutations       | n!              | factorial          | [1,2],[2,1]     | 

Menomonic poems
Subsets are twice as powerful exponentially
Combos are nCk
Perms are facts
